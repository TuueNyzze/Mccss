# Eden Field

Eden Field is a distributed substrate with identity, sync, and governance features.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd Edenfield-main
npm install
```

2. Use the CLI (installed via `npm link` or when package is installed):

```bash
npm link
edenfield install
edenfield lease create OWNER_ID ORGANISM_ID
edenfield lease list OWNER_ID
```

Governance and leases

- The repository includes a simple `LeaseManager` at `core/leases.js` that stores `leases.json` in the repo root.
- Permission enforcement now supports organism-scoped checks and allows lease owners to be treated as administrators for their organisms.
- The `PermissionContext` exposes `subjectId` so callers can present their identity when making guarded requests.

Developer checks

```bash
cd Edenfield-main
npm run lint
npm test
```

If you want me to run lint/test here, I can attempt that — or run the commands above in your environment.

Safe auto-build / watch mode

The repository includes a safe watch/build helper at `bin/watch-build.js` and a `dev:watch` script.

- Run locally: `npm run dev:watch` — this watches repo files and runs `npm run build` when files change.
- The watcher uses debounce and enforces a minimum interval between builds (defaults: 500ms debounce, 60s min-interval).
- Hourly caps prevent runaway build storms (default 60 builds/hour).
- Remote triggering is disabled by default. To enable a guarded remote trigger set these environment variables before running the watcher:

```bash
export BUILD_TRIGGER_ENABLED=true
export BUILD_TRIGGER_TOKEN="your-secret-token"
export BUILD_TRIGGER_PORT=9123
node ./bin/watch-build.js
```

The remote trigger endpoint is `POST /trigger` and requires the header `x-build-token` matching `BUILD_TRIGGER_TOKEN`. The watcher enforces rate limits and a minimum interval to avoid uncontrolled loops or resource exhaustion. Do not enable remote triggers without securing the token and limiting network exposure.
# Eden Field - Distributed Substrate v500

A sophisticated, production-grade PWA framework for building distributed, conflict-aware applications with robust identity and permission management.

## Features

🔄 **Real-Time Synchronization**
- Automatic background sync with conflict resolution
- Queue-based operation batching
- Offline-first architecture

👤 **Identity Management**
- Built-in user identity and profile system
- Persistent identity storage
- Session management

🔐 **Permission System**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Capability-based security model
- Fine-grained authorization at operation boundaries


Packaging & releases

- Use `node ./bin/release.js` to create a release artifact (runs `npm pack` in `Edenfield-main`).
- A manual GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) will produce and attach a packaged `.tgz` for distribution.

Administration & signed leases

- A minimal admin HTTP server is available at `bin/admin-server.js`. It requires `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` to be set and exposes endpoints to list, create, revoke leases, generate signed lease tokens, and read recent audit log entries.
- Signed lease tokens use HMAC (HS256). Set `LEASE_SIGNING_SECRET` or let the system generate a secret file `lease_secret` in the repo root. Tokens are created with `POST /leases/:id/token` and can be verified via `core/lease-tokens.js`.

Production hardening & orchestration

- TLS/mTLS: `bin/admin-server.js` supports TLS when `ADMIN_TLS_KEY` and `ADMIN_TLS_CERT` point to key/cert files. Set `ADMIN_MTLS=true` to require client certificates (mTLS).
- OIDC: set `OIDC_JWKS_URI` to enable OIDC JWKS verification for Bearer tokens; falls back to signed lease tokens if not configured.
- Docker: `Edenfield-main/Dockerfile` and top-level `docker-compose.yml` are provided for local orchestration.
- Kubernetes: manifests live in `k8s/` (Deployment, Service, CronJob for backups). They assume PVCs for data and backups; adapt before production.
- Secrets: sample helper `core/vault.js` can fetch secrets from HashiCorp Vault when `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` are set.
- Rotation & backups: `bin/rotate-lease-secret.js` rotates the lease signing secret and writes an audit entry; `bin/backup.js` copies lease and audit state into `backups/`.

Observability & metrics

- `/metrics` endpoint exposes Prometheus metrics from the admin server.
- Logging uses `pino` for structured logs; configure `LOG_LEVEL` via env.
 
Security & CI gating

- The repository includes a `Security CI` workflow that runs linting, unit tests, and `npm audit --audit-level=high`. The workflow fails if high-severity vulnerabilities are detected.
- A `CodeQL` analysis workflow runs static analysis for security issues on push and PRs to `main`.
- Dependabot is configured to open weekly dependency update PRs for `Edenfield-main` via `.github/dependabot.yml`.
- Optional Snyk scanning is available when `SNYK_TOKEN` is added to repository secrets; the Security CI includes a step that runs `snyk test` if the token is present.

Operational guidance:
- Protect the `main` branch with required status checks (`Security CI`, `CodeQL`, and any other important checks).
- Enable repository secret scanning and Dependabot alerts in repository settings.
- Configure automated vulnerability notifications and review Dependabot PRs promptly. Consider auto-merging low-risk patch/minor updates after verification.

## Core Concepts

### Sync Queue
Operations are queued locally and synced to remote server in the background:

```javascript
Sync.queue({
  type: "update",
  entity: "document",
  id: "doc-id",
  data: { /* ... */ }
});
```

### Conflict Resolution
When local and remote changes conflict, the system automatically resolves them:

```javascript
const resolved = Sync.resolveConflict(localVersion, remoteVersion);
// Returns merged version
```

### Permission Guards
All operations are guarded by permission checks:

```javascript
// Throws error if user lacks 'syncQueue' permission
Sync.queue({ /* ... */ });
```

### Event System
Modules communicate asynchronously via events:

```javascript
import { Events } from "./core/events.js";

// Subscribe
Events.on("sync:complete", (data) => {
  console.log("Sync completed:", data);
});

// Emit
Events.emit("sync:complete", { timestamp: Date.now() });
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# API Configuration
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_SYNC_INTERVAL=30000

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG=false
VITE_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION=true
```

### Manifest Configuration

Customize PWA settings in `manifest.json`:
- App name and description
- Theme colors
- Display mode (standalone, fullscreen, etc.)
- Icons

## API Reference

### Sync Module

```javascript
// Initialize sync system
Sync.init()

// Queue operation for sync
Sync.queue(action)

// Pull remote changes
await Sync.pull()

// Resolve conflict
Sync.resolveConflict(local, remote)

// Log sync event
Sync.log(entry)
```

### Identity Module

```javascript
// Load identity from storage
identity.load()

// Save identity to storage
identity.save(profile)

// Check if identity exists
identity.exists()
```

### State Module

```javascript
// Subscribe to state changes
State.subscribe("path.to.data", callback)

// Update state
State.update("path.to.data", newValue)

// Get current state
State.get("path.to.data")
```

### Events Module

```javascript
// Subscribe to event
Events.on("event:name", callback)

// Subscribe once
Events.once("event:name", callback)

// Unsubscribe
Events.off("event:name", callback)

// Emit event
Events.emit("event:name", data)
```

### Permissions Module

```javascript
// Check capability
Guards.require("capability_name") // throws if not allowed

// Run with permission check
Guards.checkPermission("action_name") // returns boolean
```

## Development
